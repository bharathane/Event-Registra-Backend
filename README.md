The backend code for the event registration form is developed using Node.js, a robust and efficient runtime for server-side JavaScript. Leveraging popular libraries and modules such as Express, Nodemailer, SQLite3, and others, this backend system ensures a seamless and secure registration process.

Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, powers the server-side logic, handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently. The use of Express.json facilitates the parsing of incoming JSON data, allowing the application to process and store registration information effectively.

Nodemailer, a powerful email sending library for Node.js, is integrated to automate the confirmation email process. This ensures that registrants receive timely and personalized confirmation emails upon successful registration, enhancing communication and providing attendees with essential event details.

SQLite3 and SQLite are employed as the database engines, offering a lightweight and reliable solution for storing registration data. This choice allows for easy setup, maintenance, and scalability while ensuring the application's responsiveness. The backend code effectively utilizes these databases to store and retrieve registration details, creating a centralized and easily accessible repository for event organizers.

Additionally, the integration of the Express.path module facilitates handling and manipulation of file paths, ensuring a smooth file management process within the application.

In summary, the backend code is a well-architected and modular Node.js application that combines the power of Express, Nodemailer, SQLite3, SQLite, Express.json, and path modules. This combination ensures a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for managing event registrations, sending confirmation emails, and maintaining a centralized database of attendees.
